                    <p>Following the "transport's economization", public transportation was rapidly constructed and reconstructed to (at least aimed to) simultaneously achieve economic, social, and environmental goals. However, even with a massive volume of literature around accessibility, the actual relationship between public transport accessibility and socioeconomic status has hitherto received scant attention from scholars. This study thus addresses this gap using a GIS-based quantitative approach. Transit accessibility with varied characterization approaches (including gravity method, cumulative opportunities method and spatial separation method) was calculated from various sources (including transit network, timetable road network, POIs and other socioeconomic data), using ArcGIS network analyst. In the analysis stage, this project first explored the spatial heterogeneity of urban deprivation and public transport accessibility using methods such as Global Moran's I, Getis-Ord Gi*, and Anselin Local Moran's I. Spatial patterns and autocorrelation is identified. Then, this study carried out a correlational analysis to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between deprivation and accessibility. Lastly, the factors which contribute to this relationship were briefly discussed.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>In response to the urban flooding, China adopted its version of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), namely “sponge city”. This study thus aims to evaluate the extent to which SUDS could mitigate flooding hazards in urban watersheds, using the Lin-gang area in Shanghai as a case study. In the first research question, Shanghai's vulnerability to pluvial flooding hazards is assessed by constructing a model considering both biophysical and socioeconomic vulnerability, with which the necessity of SUDS could be understood. Then, in the second research question, the effectiveness of SUDS in changing the flows and stores of water to reduce flooding risk in Shanghai is evaluated. A theoretical framework is first constructed to conceptually hypothesise the effect of SUDS on the urban water cycle stores and flows using system concepts. It was suggested that SUDS could reduce runoff by increasing interception, infiltration, and evapotranspiration. The conceptual framework is then substantiated using results from an empirical rainfall-runoff simulation. Building on the theoretical framework, the Lin-gang area (with SUDS implemented) is studied comparatively with an area with conventional urban development. Field-collected and remotely sensed data indicates that the area with SUDS has higher values of infiltration and interception than the conventional development area, with difference that is statistically significant at p=0.005 level. A distributed hydrologic-hydraulics urban watershed model, SWMM, was adopted to analyse the effect of SUDS on the water cycle. It was found that peak volumes of system surface runoff and flooding could be reduced by SUDS significantly (reduction of 55.12% and 78.47%, respectively, when return period is one year), and the water cycle responds slower and less vigorously to extreme precipitation. The water cycle with SUDS also has a smaller distribution of sub-catchments with larger runoff magnitude (three times smaller distribution of sub-catchments with > 0.10 CMS), and runoff was found to recede faster than in conventional development.</p>

                    <p>This study utilised geographic information systems (GIS) to analyse the correlation between different service and facility point of interests (POI) density and mean housing price of 2049 residence points (in the first quarter of 2017) in Nanjing, China. Service and facility points focused in this study include shops, restaurants, medical services, financial services, office buildings and recreation facilities. Spearman's rank correlation test shows that the density of restaurant, financial service, office building and recreation facility POI all displayed statistically significant (at p = 0.01 level) positive correlation with the mean housing prices</p>

                    <p>This research investigates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Shanghai, China. The study area is located in the Shanghai metropolitan area in the Yangtze River Delta region. The methodology involves obtaining Landsat 8 data, finding training samples for urban, water, non-agricultural vegetation and agriculture land use, conducting a maximum likelihood classification, and using zonal statistics to analyze the Thermal Infrared (TIR) values. The results of the study show that there is a higher mean TIR value in urban areas, confirming the hypothesis of UHI effect in the Shanghai metropolitan area. However, the reliability of the classification is limited, and not all urban land is identified, which could affect the summarized values from the Zonal statistics tool.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>
                    <p>The equity of health-seeking behaviors of groups using different transportations is an important metric for health outcome disparities among them. Recently, smart card data and taxi trajectory data have been used extensively but separately to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of health-seeking behavior and healthcare accessibility. However, the differences in health-seeking behavior among groups by different transportations have hitherto received scant attention from scholars. To fill the gap, this paper aimed to investigate the equity in health-seeking behavior of groups using different transportations. With sets of spatial and temporal constraints, we first extracted health-seeking behaviors by bus and taxi from smart card data and taxi trajectory data from Beijing during 13–17 April 2015. Then, health-seeking behaviors of groups by bus and taxi were compared regarding the coverage of hospital service areas, time efficiency to seek healthcare, and transportation access. The results indicated that there are inequities in groups using different travel modes to seek healthcare regarding the coverage of hospital service areas, time efficiency to seek healthcare, and transportation access. They provide some suggestions for mode-specific interventions to narrow health disparity, which might be more efficient than a one-size-fits-all intervention.</p>
