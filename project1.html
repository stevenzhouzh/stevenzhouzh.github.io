                    <p>Following the "transport's economization", public transportation was rapidly constructed and reconstructed to (at least aimed to) simultaneously achieve economic, social, and environmental goals. However, even with a massive volume of literature around accessibility, the actual relationship between public transport accessibility and socioeconomic status has hitherto received scant attention from scholars. This study thus addresses this gap using a GIS-based quantitative approach. Transit accessibility with varied characterization approaches (including gravity method, cumulative opportunities method and spatial separation method) was calculated from various sources (including transit network, timetable road network, POIs and other socioeconomic data), using ArcGIS network analyst. In the analysis stage, this project first explored the spatial heterogeneity of urban deprivation and public transport accessibility using methods such as Global Moran's I, Getis-Ord Gi*, and Anselin Local Moran's I. Spatial patterns and autocorrelation is identified. Then, this study carried out a correlational analysis to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between deprivation and accessibility. Lastly, the factors which contribute to this relationship were briefly discussed.</p>

                        <h3>Conceptual Framework</h3>
                        <p>The transportation network data will be first pre-processed, followed by construction of a multilayered network dataset, combing a range of different modes including buses routes, underground and overground railway lines, light rail lines, and walking. After establishing the network dataset, an origin-destination (O-D) cost matrix will be produced.</p>
                        <p>After producing the O-D cost matrix, this study will calculate the spatial integral public transit accessibility with both the spatial separation and gravity method.</p>
                        <p>The data analysis of this study includes (1) spatial analysis of the heterogeneity and autocorrelation of urban depri- vation and transit accessibility (2) correlational analyses to evaluate the correlation between urban deprivation and transit accessibility.</p>

                            <p>Firstly, the precense of global spatial autocorrelation will be detercted using the Global Moran's I statistic. The Global Moran's I Statistic is defined as:</p>

                            <p>Where n is the total number of spatial units, wi,j(d) is the spatial weight between i and j, defined by a spatial weight matrix, a symmetric Boolean matrix. zi is the devi- ation of the attribute value of a feature i from the global mean of that attribute.</p>
                            <p>If the z-score is positive, then a positive spatial autocor- relation is foundm, and vice versa.</p>
                            <p>If a statistically significant global spatial autocorrelation is found, the Getis-Ord General G statistic can then be used to evaluate the characteristic of the autocorrelation, identifying whether it is the low or high values. Getis-Ord General G statistic is defined as:</p>

                            <p>The Local Moran's I statistic, which was decomposed from the Global Moran's I statistic to the local level by Luc Anselin, can be used to identify hotspots and spatial outliers. The I statistic is defined as:</p>

                        <p>The IoD includes not only economic deprivation, but includes a variety of different categories of deprivation (See Figure 2.6).</p>

                        <p>This study thus uses a multi-model approach for measuring accessibility - calculates both spatial separation and gravity-based accessibility.</p>

                        <section>
                            <h4>Spatial separation method</h4>
                            <p>The spatial separational accessibility for each Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) is defined as the average spatial separation to centroids of all other LSOAs. Thus, the spatial separational method accessibility in this study can be mathematically defined as:</p>
                            <!-- Source: (original work) Steven Zhou-->
                            <img src="images/p1_for5.png" alt="Formula of the spatial separational method accessibility" class="formula">
                            <p>Where n is the number of LSOAs, Tij is the spatial separation from i to j.</p>
                        </section>

                        <section>
                            <h4>Gravity-based method</h4>
                            <p>Gravity-based method of accessibility calculation count and weight oppor- tunities with an attraction factor, and discounts it with the separation factor. The relative accessibility of zone i to j using the gravity method can then be characterized by:</p>

                            <img src="images/p1_for6.png" alt="Formula of the relative accessibility of zone i to j using the gravity metho" class="formula">
                            <p>Where Oi,j is the number of opportunities in zone i and j respectively, and tij is the spatial separation between zone i and j.</p>
                            <p>Here, Oi does not have a discount factor since it is directly in zone i. Oj is discounted by a reciprocals factor of the spatial separation (tij). This would mean that if the number of opportunities is larger in zone j, accessibility will be higher.</p>
                            <p>The integral accessibility for zone i using the gravity method can be formulated as:</p>

                        <section>
                            <h4>Determining spatial separation</h4>
                            <p>The spatial separation values used for calcula- tion of accessibility is determined by constructing a OD cost matrix.</p>
                            <p>The transit network dataset, constructed from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files, and road networks from OSM are used to construct a multi-layered transit and pedestrain network. Using network analysis methods, a OD cost matrix is then solved to find the transit time between each combination of centroids of LSOAs in London.</p>

                        <section>
                            <h4>Determining opportunities</h4>
                            <p>Another component for measuring accessibility is the number of opportunities, or the “attraction strength” of the destination.</p>
                            <p>This study uses the commuting flow OD data from the census, providing the number of commuters that are commuting between each set ofLSOAs on a daily basis. From this data, the number of job opportinities in each LSOA can be estimated.</p>

                            <p>A analysis of global autocorrelation using Moran's I statistic returned a I value of 0.915541 , which yielded a z-score of 283.249050 with p&lt;0.001. The positive z-score indicates a positive spatial autocorrelation at the p=0.001 level. Further analysis using Getis-Ord General G returned a observed G value of 0.000215, yielding a z-score of 102.092016 with p&lt;0.001. This indicates that it is mainly the higher values which are clustred.</p>

                            <p>A analysis of global autocorrelation using Moran's I statistic returned a I value of 0.118189 , which yield- ed a z-score of 47.022867 with p&lt;0.001. The positive z-score indicates a positive spatial autocorrelation at the p=0.001 level. Further analysis using Getis-Ord General G returned a observed G value of 0.001390, yielding a z-score of 46.026131 with p&lt;0.001. This indicates that it is mainly the higher values which are clustred.</p>

                            <p>Local autocorrelation results using Anselin Local Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* are shown in Figure 3.5 and 3.6.</p>
