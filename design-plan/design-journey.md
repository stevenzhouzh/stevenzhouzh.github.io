# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **please do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Existing Project (Milestone 1)

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

### Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project (TODO: 1 or 2)


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

TODO: site's _cohesive_ audience


### Audience's Goals (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

- TODO: goal 1
- TODO: goal 2
- TODO: ...


## Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- TODO: idea 1
- TODO: idea 2
- TODO: ...


### Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch several iterations of your interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)

TODO: idea sketches


### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)
> Create _polished_ sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

TODO: final sketch(es)


### Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (3-5 sentences)

TODO: design rationale


## Interactivity Implementation Plan (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Planning Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.

TODO: planning sketches


### Interactivity Pseudocode Plan (Milestone 1)
> Write your interactivity pseudocode plan here.
> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Please do not put JavaScript code here.

```
TODO: pseudocode
```


### "Ambitious" Interactivity Explanation (Milestone 1)
> In your own words, concisely explain why you believe your interactivity meets the "ambitious" requirement.
> This should be a few sentences. (1-3 sentences)

TODO: ambitious justification


## Grading (Final Submission)

### Interactivity Usability Justification (Final Submission)
> Explain how your design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a large paragraph (4-6 sentences)

TODO: interactivity rationale


### Tell Us What to Grade (Final Submission)
> We aren't re-grading your Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed, we won't grade it.

TODO: what should we grade


### Collaborators (Final Submission)
> List any persons you collaborated with on this project.

TODO: list your collaborators


### Reference Resources (Final Submission)
> Please cite any external resources you referenced in the creation of your project.
> (i.e. W3Schools, StackOverflow, Mozilla, etc.)

TODO: list reference resources


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

TODO: self-reflection


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!
